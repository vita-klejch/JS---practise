      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const players2 = players;

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      players2[0] = "Vita";

      // now here is the problem!
      console.log(players);

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      players4 = players.slice();
      players4[0] = "XXXXX";
      console.log(players);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      players_concat = [].concat(players);
      players_concat[0] = "CONCAT player";
      console.log(players_concat);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const players3 = [...players];
      players3[1] = "XXXXXXXXXX";
      console.log(players3);
      console.log(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const person2 = person;
      // person2.age = 42;
      // console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const person3 = { ...person };
      person3.age = 33;
      console.log(person);
      console.log(person3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
